# Library-Management-System-Development
•	Spearheaded the development of a Library Management System, integrating Java with a "bookvault" database to support efficient CRUD operations, reinforcing core software engineering principles.
•	Implemented Factory Method design pattern to dynamically create event objects for different library types (Public and Academic), facilitating scalability and adaptability to future expansion needs.
•	Incorporated Singleton design pattern for crucial components: DBConnection to manage a single database connection instance, and LMSLogger for centralized logging, ensuring system robustness and consistency.
•	Designed and executed SQL queries (INSERT, UPDATE, RETRIEVE, DELETE) for event management, demonstrating proficiency in database manipulation and ensuring data integrity.
•	Developed comprehensive JUnit test cases for DBConnection and LMSLogger classes to validate the singleton pattern's implementation and for each event's calculateAdmissionFee() method, enhancing code reliability.
•	Employed best practices in Java coding and documentation, contributing to a maintainable and well-structured codebase.
•	Ensured thorough application logging, capturing both successful operations and exceptions, to facilitate debugging and operational monitoring, improving system reliability.
•	Successfully demonstrated the solution's effectiveness during a lab session and adhered to academic integrity standards, delivering the project on Brightspace within the stipulated deadline.
